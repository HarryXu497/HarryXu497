## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm currently a Grade 12 student at Richmond Hill High School who loves learning anything related to Computer Science and Software. 

**I'm highly experienced in full-stack web development**. My main tech stacks are React, Svelte/SvelteKit, JS/TS, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.

**I've explored**
* Mobile app development with Flutter and Jetpack Compose
* Statistical analysis with Python, Pandas, and Seaborn
* Ranked-choice voting algorithms with Python and Matplotlib
* From-scratch MVC web framework with Java Sockets and SQLite
