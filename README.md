## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm a Grade 12 student at Richmond Hill High School who loves learning anything related to computer science and software. 

**I'm highly experienced in full-stack web development**. My main tech stacks are React, Svelte/SvelteKit, JS/TS, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase.

**I am also highly experienced in mobile development with Flutter/Dart and Jetpack Compose/Kotlin**.
